# Challenge Context Snapshot

This repo is aligned to the Intrinsic AI for Industry challenge objective: cable handling/insertion using a visual-sensory-motor policy and industrial robot hardware stack.

Primary public challenge page:
- https://www.intrinsic.ai/events/ai-for-industry-challenge

Hardware elements called out publicly and mirrored here:
- UR5e robot arm
- Robotiq Hand-E gripper
- Axia80-like wrist force/torque channel
- three wrist-mounted Basler RGB streams

Policy interface assumptions were cross-checked with local research notes in:
- `/home/umar/ws/agent_ws/docker-selkies-egl-desktop/deep-research-report.md`

For implementation details and caveats, see:
- `docs/HARDWARE_AND_POLICY_SPEC.md`
